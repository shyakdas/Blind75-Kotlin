/**
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 *
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
