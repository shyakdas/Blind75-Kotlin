## Blind 75 Questions and Solutions

### Array
1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)  

   Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
   You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
   You can return the answer in any order.  
   Example:-  
   Input: nums = [ 2, 7, 11, 15 ], target = 9  
   Output: [ 0, 1 ]  
   Explanation: Because nums[ 0 ] + nums[ 1 ] == 9, we return [ 0, 1 ].  

   #### Solution 1:- Brute Force  
   Here we have an array, nums = [ 1, 8, 2, 15, 5 ], target = 13      
   Step 1 -> 13 - 1 = 12, check 12 exists or not in nums -> In this case not exits    
   Step 2 -> 13 - 8 = 5, check 5 exists or not in numbs -> In this case exits.  
   Step 3 -> Return [1, 4]
   Time complexity is O(n2)  

   #### Solution 2:-
   Here we have an array, nums = [1, 8, 2, 15, 5], target = 13
   Step 1 -> Sort the array, nums = [1, 2, 5, 8, 15]
   Step 2 -> 13 - 1 = 12 -> Do binary search on nums -> Check 12 exit or not
   Step 3 -> 13 - 8 = 5 -> Do binary search on nums -> Check 5 exit or not -> Exiting
   Step 4 -> Return [1, 4]
   Time Complexity in 0(nLogn) because logn for sorting

   #### Solution 3:-
   Here we have an array, nums = [1, 8, 2, 15, 5], target = 13  
   Step 1 -> Create a hashMap to store value and index  
   | Key      | Value |
   |----------|----------|

   Step 2:- 13 - 1 = 12 -> Check 12, exists or not in this hashMap -> Not exits
   Store the value and index in hashMap  
   | Key      | Value    |  
   |----------|----------|
   |    1     |     0    |
   
   Step 3:- 13 - 8 = 5 -> Check 5, exists or not in this hasMap -> Not exists
   Store the value and index in hashMap  
   | Key      | Value    |  
   |----------|----------|
   |    1     |     0    |
   |    8     |     1    |
   
   Step 4: 13 - 2 = Check 11, exists or not in this hasMap -> Not exists
   Store the value and index in hashMap  
   | Key      | Value    |  
   |----------|----------|
   |    1     |     0    |
   |    8     |     1    |
   |    2     |     2    |

   Step 5: 13 - 15 = Check -2, exists or not in this hasMap -> Not exists
   Store the value and index in hashMap
   | Key      | Value    |  
   |----------|----------|
   |    1     |     0    |
   |    8     |     1    |
   |    2     |     2    |
   |    15     |     3    |

   Step 6: 13 - 5 = Check 8, exists or not in this hasMap -> exists
   | Key      | Value    |  
   |----------|----------|
   |    1     |     0    |
   |    8     |     1    |
   |    2     |     2    |
   |    15     |     3    |

   Return the index of 8 that is 1, and return the index of 5 that is 4  
   Return [1, 4]  
   Time Complexity O(n)  
   Space Complexity O(n)
